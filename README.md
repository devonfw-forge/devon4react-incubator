# Office-Addin-TaskPane-React

Devon4react provides a solution to compact multiple columns in just one with multiple rows, taken from the sheet ‘DynamicColumns’ and shown in the task pane with inputs to fill in.

Uses the API Office to execute excel native and customized functions defined by users.

This repository contains the source code used by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) when you create a new Office Add-in that appears in the task pane. You can also use this repository as a sample to base your own project from if you choose not to use the generator.
